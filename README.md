## Project Scope - mid 2015

- Create a Bootstrap responsive site using .PSD wireframe prototypes
- Set-up and then integrate the HTML, CSS, and javascript into the Drupal CMS.

## Project Notes

**Development Notes:**

- All code seen here has been cleared for public viewing by e-mds.com 
- To prevent coding redundancy, I used a simple modular PHP approach that kept the various components separated into snippets.
- I began by using a popular Bootstrap theme, but it was top-heavy and hard to modify, so I ended up creating my own from scratch.
- Any code you see in this repository was completely my own.  Most of it was coded prior to the Drupal integration.
- Unfortunately (in respect to using this project as a portfolio piece), because Github Pages doesn't work with .PHP, a WAMP environment is required to render the full site.

**Technologies used:**

- HTML5
- LESS | CSS3
- Bootstrap 3
- javascript | jQuery library
- Adobe's Photoshop
- Drupal Content Management System (CMS)
	- PHP
	- MySQL
	- a little bit of Apache tweaking
- Github
